# Health-Status-Bracelet
The prevalence of heart diseases around all over the world has been growing rapidly and the ECG equipment used in hospitals for heart health checkups is costly and it is not always possible to visit a doctor. Health status bracelet is developed in such a way that the patient can do a heart health checkup at home itself as heart patients are required to keep a record of their health.  So, our prototype is a system that functions to give fast detection of the possibility of pulmonary restrictions.
